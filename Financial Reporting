What is this project?
Financial analytics + budgeting (Budget vs Actuals) in Excel with the release of a client reporting package.

Scope of work
We built a Plan (budget) vs Actuals (actual) model for revenue and key cost items (COGS, OPEX).
We performed variance analysis: calculation of Δ = Actual − Plan and Execution Rate = Actual/Plan with a materiality threshold.
We created a KPI dashboard: Revenue Actual Total, Revenue Execution %, delta to plan.
Prepared an Executive Summary: explanation of drivers (price/volume/mix/timing), recommendations, and responsible parties.
Formulated control procedures: tie-out totals (±0.5%), uniform formats, rule for highlighting overspending.

Methodology/metrics
Budget vs Actuals: basic budgeting cycle (Beginner Budgeting) — comparison of plan and actuals on a monthly basis/by CC.
Variance decomposition: identification of deviations in Revenue/COGS and their causes (seasonality/volume, price/mix, logistics surcharges).
Performance KPI: Execution % by revenue ≈ 99.9% (near-plan), Δ — within the acceptable range.
Governance: SLA “EOM + 3”, change log, uniform rounding policy (€ without cents).

Result for stakeholders
KPI + Executive Summary (what/why/so-what/next).
